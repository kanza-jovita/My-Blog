              Welcome to my first blog post detailing my journey into software
              engineering with HTML and CSS.HTML is the definitive markup
              language for crafting exceptional web pages. Cascading Style
              Sheets (CSS) is a language used to style and format HTML
              documents. It can be used to define how elements should look on a
              screen, on paper, or in other media.I was able to build my first
              website from scratch. My journey taught me that with determination
              and hard work, anything is possible.My facilitators established a
              safe and welcoming atmosphere where I felt comfortable expressing
              my thoughts, questions, and concerns about HTML and CSS. This
              encouraged me to participate actively. They recognized that we
              each have diverse learning styles and preferences, and adapted
              their teaching methods to accommodate these differences. I
              understood that practice is key to perfection.I am grateful for
              the endless support and encouragement I received from my
              facilitators, Samson, Mark, and Steven, who helped me navigate the
              challenging parts with ease. I remain curious about what lies
              ahead and am eager to continue learning and pushing myself beyond
              what I thought possible. This coding journey has taught me that
              there is always more to learn, and I am eager to expand my
              knowledge daily. Writing code can be frustrating, but I have
              learned to find and solve the problem, which has been my greatest
              learning point.

            <p class="card-text">
              My journey into web development began with a simple curiosity and
              a desire to create something of my own. Through dedication and a
              hands-on approach, I immersed myself in the world of online
              tutorials and coding exercises, mastering HTML and CSS concepts.
              Every milestone that I achieved fueled my confidence and
              motivation to keep learning, whether it was mastering a new CSS
              layout technique or successfully troubleshooting a coding bug.
              With each new challenge, I felt a sense of accomplishment that
              left me eager to take on even more complex projects. Designing my
              own website became a testament to my creativity and attention to
              detail, and as I continued to refine my HTML and CSS skills, I
              noticed significant growth in several areas. My CSS styling
              techniques evolved, allowing me to create beautiful designs, and I
              developed confidence in debugging and honing my problem-solving
              abilities. The journey has been a challenging yet rewarding one,
              and it has left me with a sense of pride in my accomplishments and
              a drive to continue learning and improving.

              I've extensively used Git for version control. Git helps in code
              management, collaboration, and streamlining development workflows.
              I learned Git's basics such as init, add, commit, push, and pull
              to advanced usage.I adhere to version control best practices such
              as writing descriptive commit messages, using a consistent
              branching strategy, and regularly pulling changes from the remote
              repository.

              The HTML and CSS class taught me how to structure web content with
              semantic HTML elements, apply styling to text, backgrounds and
              layouts, and create visually appealing and well-designed web
              pages. I learned the importance of responsive web design,how to
              use popular CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, and how to ensure web
              accessibility for all users. Overall, the class equipped me with
              foundational knowledge and skills to pursue further learning and
              explore career opportunities in web development.
